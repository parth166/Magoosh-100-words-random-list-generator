# Magoosh-100-words-random-list-generator
This is a 50 word random list generator from the 1000 words list which helped me to revise on the go from the extensive word list.

List of libraries needed:
1: Pandas
2: PyPDF2
3: python-docx

  - The command for installing PyPDF2 is pip insall pypdf2.
  - The command for installing python-docx is pip install python-docx.
  
I have also attached the magoosh file in the docx.

Replace the path with the downloaded magoosh doc file and generate the list.
